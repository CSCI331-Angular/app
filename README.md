-Angular Tour of Heroes:
  Angular Tour of Heroes is a tutorial project we followed from the Angular documentation to understand it better.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to download an Angular project and run it locally:
1. Make sure you have nodeJS installed
2. Clone the repo to your local machine
3. Open a terminal in the directory you cloned the repo to
4. Run the command 'npm install' to install node modules
5. Run the command 'npm serve' to launch the Angular project

If you get errors saying you do not have permission to run, you may have to open Windows Powershell as an administrator
and enter the command 'Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope LocalMachine'. This is a permission change that 
will allow you the proper permissions. If you would like to change your permissions back after you enter this command
'Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Default -Scope LocalMachine'.
